# 🚨 Render Deployment Fix

## The Problem You're Experiencing

```bash
sh: 1: vite: not found
==> Build failed 😞
```

This happens because Vite is in `devDependencies` but the build process needs it.

## ✅ Immediate Fix

I've already updated your configuration files. Here's what changed:

### 1. Updated render.yaml
```yaml
buildCommand: ./deploy-render.sh  # ← Changed from basic npm install
```

### 2. Created deploy-render.sh
- Installs ALL dependencies (including dev ones like Vite)
- Runs database migrations
- Builds with proper verification
- Provides clear error messages

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Push the fixes to GitHub:**
```bash
git add render.yaml deploy-render.sh
git commit -m "Fix Render deployment build issues"
git push
```

2. **Try deployment again** - it should now work correctly

3. **Alternative simple fix** (if you prefer):
   - In Render dashboard, manually set build command to:
   ```bash
   npm ci --include=dev && npm run build
   ```

## Why This Fixes It

Your original build command only installed production dependencies:
```bash
npm install && npm run build  # ❌ Missing dev dependencies
```

The fix ensures dev dependencies are available:
```bash
npm ci --include=dev && npm run build  # ✅ Includes Vite, ESBuild, etc.
```

## After Successful Deployment

Update your hardware code with the new Render URL:

### ESP32/ESP8266
```cpp
const char* serverURL = "https://your-app.onrender.com";
```

### Raspberry Pi
```python
API_BASE = "https://your-app.onrender.com"
```

Your plant monitoring system will work exactly the same, just on Render instead of Replit! 🌱
